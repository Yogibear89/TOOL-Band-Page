      <p style="font-size:30px">
                Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles, CA Formed in 1990.To date, the band has released five studio albums, one
            EP and one box set.
            They emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and became a dominant act in the
            alternative metal movement
            with the release of their follow-up album Ã†nima in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts,
            and a message of
            personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001)and 10,000 Days (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international
            commercial success.
            Their fifth studio album, Fear Inoculum, their first in thirteen years, was released on August 30, 2019 to widespread
            critical acclaim.
            Prior to its release, the band had sold over 13 million albums in the US alone.
            Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a
            style-transcending
            act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music
            industry is ambivalent,
            at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.
